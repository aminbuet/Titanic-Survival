# Titanic-Survival
In this project you will use a Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic

The RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage in 1912, crossing the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York City. The ship never completed the voyage, sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg, bringing down 1,502 of 2,224 passengers onboard.

In this project we will create a __Logistic Regression model__ that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on features like age and class.

The data we will be using for training our model is provided by Kaggle.
